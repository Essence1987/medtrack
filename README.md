## Description
Our motivation for completing this application is to make it easier for medical school professionals (such as professors, physicians, and admin) to monitor student's progress and reviews of their experiences as they go through their clinical rotations.


We decided to build this project to make it easier for medical school staff to have an easier way to supervise the students as well as insure they are getting a quality education. Clincal rotations are one of the most important aspects of the final two years of a medical student's education. It is vital that they are recieving proper guidance from the physician's they shadow. Being able to see student's feedback on the physician's medical knowledge, medical judgement, teaching skills, and humanistic quality (also called "bedside manner"), rated on a scale from 1-10, will help improve future healthcare through the collective wisdom of those who live the journey firsthand.


This application helps solve the problem of a possibly continuing a clinical rotation experience that is suboptimal to the learning of the students involved. Not only will this provide a safe space for students to share their experiences during rotations (through authentication measures built-in to the application), it also encourages students to give constructive feedback so future students can be given the best possible education with each new influx of students going into their final two years of education.


From building this application, we learned the power and capabilities of incorporating an API with a database. We also learned how much resourceful and flexible the NPM registry can be when designing an application. There is a plethora of code within NPM that can be used to help create out-of-the-box ideas that solve possible conflicts in turning a framework idea into reality. In addition, we also learned that authentication and privacy are especially important when dealing with sensitive information such as patient history due to HIPPA privacy laws.
